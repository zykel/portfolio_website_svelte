	"vehicle_description_paragraph_1": "In this project, the goal was to explore the results of a statistical conflict research method. The method was used to integrate several spatio-temporal conflict event data sets based on a set of assumptions. As the integration method produced unexpected results, we used visual exploration to better understand what was happening under the hood.",
	"vehicle_description_paragraph_2": "To produce the corresponding dashboard, we developed a deeper understanding of how the integration method works to identify the aspects relevant for further exploration. We designed and tested various visualizations to identify the most suitable ways to represent the multi-faceted information contained in the integration results. The visualizations were linked, so they could be explored in synchrony via filtering and changing parameters. The development process took place in close collaboration with conflict research experts.",
	"vehicle_description_paragraph_3": "With the final system, we could successfully identify multiple reasons for why the integration results looked the way they did.",
	"vehicle_description_paragraph_4": "Disclaimer: As this was my first major project and all the calculations are performed client-side, the application takes some time for certain steps, depending on which device it is opened on.",
	"caption_vehicle_all_events": "A view on the data using stacked bar charts. The use of four different color helps to distinguish the four different data sets that were integrated",
	"caption_vehicle_bin_highlighting": "Hovering over a bin of the temporal histogram highlights all events that took place during the corresponding interval",
	"caption_vehicle_paramultiples": "Different distributions can be compared, including indications for how similar they are to each other",
	"caption_vehicle_drill_down": "The stacked bar charts can be drilled into",
	"caption_vehicle_node_highlight": "When hovering over a node in a hierarchical graph view, the nodes further down in the hierarchy are highlighted, and the level of the hovered node in the hierarchy is indicated via a dashed line",

	"methane_description_paragraph_1": "During my freelance work for Data&Design, Rudi O'Reilly Meehan and I developed a visual data story to introduce a data set reporting on methane emissions by the International Methane Emissions Observatory. The story adapts the navigation popularized by video-based social media stories. Tapping the left or right side of the screen allows to navigate forwards or backwards, and pressing and holding the screen pauses the playback.",
	"methane_description_paragraph_2": "The story itself, however, is not a video, but consists of animated HTML elements. This allows the viewer to interact directly with the underlying data to explore it at the end of the story.",
	"caption_methane_instructions": "Navigation instructions at the beginning of the story",
	"caption_methane_zoomout": "During the story, data points are introduced via animation, accompanied by a textual narrative. At the top of the view, the story progress is visualized",
	"caption_methane_interaction": "The data can be filtered based on sector, emission rate, or date by interacting with the legend",
	"caption_methane_zoom_pan": "The map can be panned and zoomed into",

	"characterization_description_paragraph_1": "To better understand how visual data stories are commonly written, we collected 130 online stories to analyze what kind of storytelling techniques they use.",
	"characterization_description_paragraph_2": "We focused on stories with a spatio-temporal context, as systematic analyses of them were still quite sparse. To classify the stories based on the storytelling techniques they use, we merged and adapted three existing design spaces. We analyzed the results of the classification by exploring overall distributions, comparing subsets, identifying trends, and using advanced techniques like multidimensional scaling.",
	"characterization_description_paragraph_3": "We summarized the results in an interactive report which facilitates an easy combination of visualizations and textual explanations, while providing the option to inspect the underlying code for full transparency.",
	"caption_characterization_deviations": "For a subset of stories, bars depict how far the usage of the different storytelling techniques deviates from the average for that subset",
	"caption_characterization_trends": "The trends over the past five years regarding the average usage frequency of different storytelling techniques",
	"caption_characterization_mds": "The result of multidimensional scaling: Each circle represents one story, and the proximity of the circles represents how similar the corresponding stories are to each other",
	"caption_characterization_sources": "A comparison of the pairwise similarities between different story sources, like The New York Times (NYT)",
	"caption_characterization_distribution": "The distribution of the pairwise similarities between all stories",

	"endovis_description_paragraph_1": "Integrated operating rooms provide rich and heterogeneous data about surgical procedures. This includes information about the different phases of a procedure, the instruments used, and the measurements of different devices. Such information is commonly time-dependent and complex to analyze in unison.",
	"endovis_description_paragraph_2": "To allow such comprehensive analysis, we created a dashboard to inspect and filter the information side-by-side. Together with medical experts, we discussed which views of the data are relevant for them and which interactions they require for analyzing the data more deeply. As they were not always aware of the different options that exist for doing so, we tried to get a deeper understanding of the goals they had for the data, based on which we provided them with a selection of suitable options to choose from.",
	"endovis_description_paragraph_3": "This prototyping-based iterative procedure led to a solution which allowed the experts to get a much more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous data.",
	"caption_endovis_procedures": "A set of bar charts that can be re-arranged in synchrony",
	"caption_endovis_align": "A temporal alignment point can be changed across multiple views in parallel",
	"caption_endovis_expand": "Individual charts displaying device measurements over time can be enlarged for closer inspection",

	"exex_description_paragraph_1": "To explain the workings of a conflict research method to scientists from the field, we developed an interactive visual data story.",
	"exex_description_paragraph_2": "In the story, we introduce the different mechanics of the method step-by-step. Each view transitions directly into the next to facilitate consistency and comprehension. At the end of each section corresponding to one mechanic, the user has the option to interact with a visualization to deepen their understanding of the conveyed information.",
	"exex_description_paragraph_3": "For creating the story, I had to dig deep into the related research papers to understand the method to a degree that I can explain it to other conflict researchers. I also collaborated closely with one of the developers of the method.",
	"exex_description_paragraph_4": "We tested the story with several conflict researchers who found it to be an engaging and effective way of explaining such information.",
	"caption_exex_s1": "Each view is accompanied by a textual description to its right. At the end of each scene, the user can interact with the view",
	"caption_exex_s4": "The transitions between the views are animated smoothly",
	"caption_exex_s3": "An interaction that allows users to better understand what happens when the size of a selected temporal window changes",
