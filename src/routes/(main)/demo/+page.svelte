To explain what the different solutions I offer can encompass, I have created a demo for each of the
solutions based on an accessible example scenario. In the sceneario, the owner of a pizza restaurant
has collected the pizza sales data of the past year [1], and she wants to work with the resulting
data set. Depending on her goals and target audience, three different solutions may be suitable: -
Dashboard: The owner has some questions in mind but also wants to explore the data on her own. The
target audience... - Analytical report: The owner has specific questions in mind that she would like
to et answers for. Based in the data, she wants to take informed decisions. The target audience... -
Data story: The owner wants to share the insights with her employees and other stakeholders / her
customers. The target audience...

[1] The data set was taken from XY and slightly adjusted for the demos.
